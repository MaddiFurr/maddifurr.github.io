       So you&amp;amp;rsquo;re still confused as to what the purpose of this whole site is. Well let me try to maybe explain it a bit.
Frist, hi! I&amp;amp;rsquo;m Maddi. I am a total nerd when it comes to computers and technology as a whole. I have such an immense fascination with it that I have spent a majority of my life learning as much as I can about how things work.

       # awoooooooo # This is what I wrote to nate. Make this a blog post lol My desktop is connected via a 10G fiber link to the core switch. You don&amp;amp;rsquo;t fully need this and honestly could get away with a 1G copper link
You need to ensure that the GPU/CPU can handle encoding video at whatever bitrate you&amp;amp;rsquo;re going to be pushing. In my case I push a full 150Mbps using AV1 (which is experimental btw, I just switched to it because HEVC looked like shit with a lot of artifacting)
