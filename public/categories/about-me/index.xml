       So you&amp;amp;rsquo;re still confused as to what the purpose of this whole site is. Well let me try to maybe explain it a bit.
Frist, hi! I&amp;amp;rsquo;m Maddi. I am a total nerd when it comes to computers and technology as a whole. I have such an immense fascination with it that I have spent a majority of my life learning as much as I can about how things work.

       # So what is exactly is a &amp;amp;ldquo;Therian&amp;amp;rdquo;? More specifically what is therianthropy? And what is a therianthrope? Well according to the Therian Wiki
The noun/term &amp;amp;rsquo;therianthropy&amp;amp;rsquo; is used to refer to the intrinsic experience surrounding someone&amp;amp;rsquo;s therian identity. It is the term used to encapsulate the broader experience, while the term &amp;amp;rsquo;therianthrope&amp;amp;rsquo; (someone who involuntarily identifies as a non-human animalistic creature) refers to the individual who experiences it.
