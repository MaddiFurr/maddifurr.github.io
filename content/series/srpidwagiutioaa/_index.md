I've officially gone off-leash. You're about to dive into "Some Random Project I Decided Was A Good Idea Under The Influence Of ADHD & Adderall." This series exists for me to talk about the random things I decided to do that sounded like a good idea. Sometimes they wind up being cool and other times... well, they just wind up.

A lot of the time, it's gonna be tech stuff. It could be related to my home lab or potentially something related to another hobby I have.... Maybe keeping track of my stuffie's names with a full-blown SQL database, who knows. But honestly, sometimes it's just whatever grabbed my **SQUIRREL**!!!!

Expect a mix of deep dives, probably too much detail, and a whole lotta "why did I even start this?" moments. It's basically a live look at my ADHD puppy brain on Adderall, trying to conquer the world one random project at a time. And yeah, it's for your entertainment. Don't judge too hard, I'm trying my hardest :pleading_face:
