## Welcome to my puppy kennel!

This is the place where I intend to share parts of my life and the things that interest me! Whether it be my home lab, gaming or other random hobbies, I hope to be able to entertain and maybe teach something along the way while incorporating my unique perspective on a whole host of topics!

<br>

This entire site is open source, but I'm not allowing contributors because this is my place to share my own unique perspective on things! Maybe in the future, I'll look in to making a place where others can contribute to cool tech related stuff, but in the mean time, check out my friend's website [Opinionated Guides](https://opguides.info/) <small>_(I swear, Vega, I will add a contribution there *eventually* >~<)_</small>

<br>

Occasionally I might have input from a friend of mine here or there, but for the most part, I intend to be the main contributor and author here!

<br>

Well take a look around, see if anything strikes your fancy!
