A little bit about me, I'm a transgender female and a furry. I also identify as <a href="/posts/2025/08/whatisatherian/what-is-a-therian/">therian ΘΔ</a>!

<br>

I currently <a href="../resume/">work at Google</a> (yes that Google) as a data center technician. I'm actively building my skills and learning more about enterprise networking, compute, security, Linux and a whole bunch of other stuff that I intend to share bits of on this site as time goes on!

<br>

I've been really enjoying watching TV shows with my [mate](https://therian.fandom.com/wiki/Mate) in the evenings before bed. I have massive pile of stuffies including one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/estradiol.dog/post/3lsfeizvs5c2g" data-nsfw-warning="true">big boi</a> that I have nammed Reggie. Obviously the pile also includes several [Blåhaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%C3%A5haj) as well.

<br>

My favorite color is purple and I love having candles lit around my house. I spend a lot of time ensuring the smells fit the current season. Summer does kinda make that hard though since it tends to get pretty warm where I live and heating up the already warm space with a candle isn't ideal.

<br>

My favorite seasons are Autumn and Winter with summer falling so far to the bottom of that list that I wish it would just fall off it entirely. I absolutely hate summer if you can't tell. It's so hot and miserable. Plus during the winter, you can always pile on more layers to stay warm. In the summer, there is only so far you can strip down without using a cheese grater on your skin. Even less so if you're in public.

<br>

I do play video games. Lately I've been playing Battle Field 6, COD, Valorant and a small bit of OSRS, though I tend to flip flop and just play what friends are playing. I also do have a pretty cool wireless VR set up as well with full body tracking. I don't tend to get in VR as often unfortunately just due to feeling so busy all the time.

<br>

I am self-diagnosed autistic and medically diagnosed ADHD. It tends to mean I hyperfixate on things sometimes for days on end just because it gives the brain happy chemicals.

If you wanna learn more about me, explore around here. Hopefully you can learn something too if the topics interest you. I'm also on basically every social platform as either estradiol.dog or estradioldog so feel free to reach out!
